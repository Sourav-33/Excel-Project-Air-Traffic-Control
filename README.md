Air Traffic Analysis Project

Introduction
Welcome to the Air Traffic Analysis Project. This project involves analyzing a dataset of domestic and international flight records in the United States to uncover key insights and trends.

Acknowledgements
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed teacher, Sir Prateek Aggarwal, and our dedicated assistant, Nawid, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout this journey.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains air traffic records of domestic and international flights in the United States. It includes 18 columns and 250 rows, detailing various metrics such as:
•	Number of Passengers
•	Number of Flights
•	Revenue per Passenger Mile
•	Availability of Seats per Mile
•	Load Factor (Revenue per Mile / Availability of Seats per Mile)

Project Objectives
The project focuses on the following objectives:
1.	Visualizing quarterly flight variations.
2.	Analyzing revenue per mile for international and domestic flights.
3.	Tracking passenger variation over time.
4.	Calculating the load factor for domestic and international flights.
5.	Answering key research questions related to travel frequency, revenue seasonality, and the impact of COVID-19 on air travel.

Dashboard Overview
A comprehensive dashboard has been created to visualize the data and facilitate analysis. It includes:
•	Quarterly flight variation charts.
•	Revenue per mile comparison for international and domestic flights.
•	Passenger variation trends.
•	Load factor analysis.
The dashboard is interactive, with slicers allowing users to filter data and derive insights for specific questions.

Research Questions and Methodology
1.	Monthly Travel Frequency:
	a.Dashboard Insight: July has the highest travel frequency (0.8 million flights), while February has the lowest (<0.7 million flights).
	b.Verification: Pivot tables were used to validate the dashboard results.
2.	Revenue and Seat Availability Seasonality:
	a.Insight: Seasonality patterns were disrupted in 2020 due to COVID-19.
	b.Methodology: Pivot tables and seasonal analysis.
3.	Future Trends Prediction:
	a.Methodology: Excel’s forecast function was utilized to predict future trends in revenue and seat availability, with confidence intervals indicated by dotted lines.
4.	COVID-19 Impact:
	a.Analysis: Basic Excel functions (SUMIFS, COUNTIFS) were used to determine the pandemic's impact, showing international flights were more affected than domestic ones.

Results and Insights
The project provides detailed visualizations and analysis addressing the research questions. Key insights include travel frequency peaks, disrupted seasonality due to COVID-19, and predicted future trends in air travel metrics.

Conclusion
The analysis successfully meets the project objectives, providing a clear understanding of air traffic patterns and the impact of external factors like COVID-19 on air travel.
